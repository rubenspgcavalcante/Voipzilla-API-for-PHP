Voipzilla Socket for PHP
===========

### A class to connect, send commands and receive data using the voipzilla socket API

About
========

**Voipzilla Socket** it's a class package of connection and log system. For a single command, that create one connection, send the command, gets it returns and close the connection. For every connection, there's a log marked by *<CONNECTED NOW>* and *<DISCONECTED NOW>*. Errors are logged too, with the mark *[ERROR]*.


How To Use
========

First include the Voipzilla_Socket.php file, after that, instatiate the object. Sets the parameters and call the command.
Any questions about the parameters, just look in *API/ReadmeAPI.txt*
**Example:**

     <?php
     	$sock = new Voipzilla_Socket(); // To set in verbose mode, just call with first parameter true: new Voipzilla_Socket(true);
        $param = array("prefix" => "cnpj_cpf", "data" => "999.999.999-99"); // We need one prefix command and the data
		try{
			echo $sock->command("cli-search-cnpj_cpf", $param ); // Will return the server response to the command
    	}
    	catch(Exception $exc){
    		$errno = $exc->getMessage(); // Gets the socket error number
    		echo socket_strerror($errno); // Will print the corresponding explanatory text. 
    	}

In *$response* is the server response to the command. If any error occur, it will trow a exception, containing the socket error code.
So, you can just use *socket_strerror()* to know what this code means.
